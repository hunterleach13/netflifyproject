	<h1>This webiste is designed to help you understand the basics of creating your own website using GitHub!</h1>
	<h3>By: Hunter Leach</h3>
	<h2>
	Let's get started with some of the basics when starting your GitHub website:
	</h2>
	<p>Here is the link to my <a href=https://github.com/hunterleach13/netflifyproject/blob/main/README.md>README.md</a> introduction file!
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>When getting started with GitHub first you must make yourself a Github account!
	<li>Next you have to create you first repository and add/commit your first README.md file.
	<li>After creating your first repository you will be propted with the steps of how to add and commit your files into GitHub
	<li>First, type cd and drag the folder in which you are using to store your files, then click enter (you can also type in git status to see if you're inside your folder)
	<li>Next, type in the command git init which will inticate you with a message saying "Initialized empty Git repository"
	<li>Your next command will be git add README.MD (or you can just type in "git add .") you can then run "git status" and if your file shows up as green in the terminal your file has been added to your repo.
	<li>Then you must comit your changes using the git commit -am and add a message describing the change you made, for example "My First Commit"
	<li>Next, use the command git branch -M main in order to cahnge the master branch over to the main branch
	<li>Then you must add the remote repo (located on GitHub's website) as the origin of this branch. This let's us send our commits to GitHub's webiste once we're done with all of our coding. The command is git remote add origin (and the link given to you by GitHub, simply copy and pasting this will be easier.)
	<li>Finally, once you have committed your changes, you need to push your chamges to GitHub. Using "git push origin main"
	</li>
</ol>
	<h2>
	Now if you want to pull some changes that you have made on another device here's what you want to do! 
	</h2>
	<li>
	<p>First, open up Terminal and enter "git pull origin main". This allows you to add changes you made on another computer with the contents of your repo that aren't avaliable on your local computer.
	</li>
	</p>
